# FILE-INTEGRITY-CHECKER

## Overview
This Python script monitors a specified directory for file changes by calculating and storing SHA-256 hashes of files. It detects:

- New files added
- Existing files modified
- Files deleted since the last check

The script stores file hashes in a JSON file (`file_hashes.json`) to track changes between runs.
